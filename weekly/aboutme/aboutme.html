  <p>My name is Brittany and I live in Utah.</p>
  <p>I’m an artist and want to be a graphic designer and illustrator I love art and am working on making my first comic book. I love anime and books, especially books from other countries and cultures as its so interesting to see the different stories people tell. Lately I’ve been reading a lot of books from China and Korea.</p>
  <p> I served a mission in the Philippines Legazpi mission and fell in love with the country and the people there. </p>
  <p>
    I have some experience already with HTML from a previous course I took at my local tech college, but I'm excited to see what may be different about this course and get a refresher as well.
