    </p>   
    <p id="orilo">
        Orilo is a giant, an ex-gladiator and current priest of an obscure mushroom god. His main act is to be fired out a cannon by his friend Corin, though he occasionally helps out as a strong man.

        Caelene, The light-fingered magician who delights in pranks and chaos and who has a range of secrets of her own.

    <p id="ship">The airship itself is both home and stage to the members of the circus, with 4 floors and enough space on the top to hold the big top tent and a double row of vendor stalls. Ringmaster Crowe can occasionally be seen talking to the ship and late at night it almost seems to be breathing.</p>
