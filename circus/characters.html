    <h3>Our 4 investigators are</h3>
    <p id="zora">  
        Zora, the sharpshooter act in the show and second in command of the circus. She is very rule oriented and seeks in vain to try and keep her friends from causing trouble.
    </p>   
    <p id="corin">
        Corin, the ships mechanic, is an innovative inventor who avoids the spotlight of the show except for when he fires his best friend of a cannon. He has a logical and scientific explanation for every situation no matter how bizarre.
    </p>   
    <p id="orilo">
        Orilo is a giant, an ex-gladiator and current priest of an obscure mushroom god. His main act is to be fired out a cannon by his friend Corin, though he occasionally helps out as a strong man.
    </p> 
    <p id="caelene">
        Caelene, The light-fingered magician who delights in pranks and chaos and who has a range of secrets of her own.
