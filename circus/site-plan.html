        Welcome to the official website for Circus of Crows, the first webcomic from Pendrom.
Contents of this site include general info about the comic, a character wiki and maps of the world as well as information on the creative team and process behind the story.</p>
<p>
  Story Summary: In an alternate world with steampunk technology. Ignorance is the best defense against what goes bump in the night. Unfortunately for our 4 heroes, performers in a flying circus on an airship, they have stumbled into a mystery and have no idea the consequences for their relentless curiosity.
  The more they find the more they lose themselves. And several of their fellow performers seem to be keeping deadly secrets.</p>
  <p>This story began as a relatively lighthearted Dungeons and dragons campaign and then I found the story and characters intriguing enough that I wanted to make a comic, so I’ve been working on refining the story and designing all the people and places that make up the world of Circus of Crows.</p>

    <p>One of the things I’m most excited for is the chance to share parts of the story that, because of player choices and the luck of the dice, I haven’t had a chance to share on screen yet in the campaign itself.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Our 4 investigators are
      </p>
        <p>
        Zora, the sharpshooter act in the show and second in command of the circus. She is very rule oriented and seeks in vain to try and keep her friends from causing trouble.</p>
        <p>
        Caelene, The light-fingered magician who delights in pranks and chaos and who has a range of secrets of her own.</p>
        <p>
        Corin, the ships mechanic, is an innovative inventor who avoids the spotlight of the show except for when he fires his best friend of a cannon. He has a logical and scientific explanation for every situation no matter how bizarre.</p>
        <p>
        Orilo is a giant, an ex-gladiator and current priest of an obscure mushroom god. His main act is to be fired out a cannon by his friend Corin, though he occasionally helps out as a strong man.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Significant Characters</h3>
       <p> 
      The Ringmaster of the circus is Alister Crowe, a bubbly, vivacious man who always wears a mask and a feather cape. He is the head of the circus and has some mysterious connection to the ship itself, Le Petit Corbeau.</p>
      <p>
      Dr Vamist, the ships medic, has a tenuous grip on reality and yet the most common sense of anyone on board.</p>
      <p>
      Sergei is the animal trainer and the reason Caelene joined the circus, a gentle giant who always has a treat for his animal friends.</p>
      <p>the leads of the acrobat team are Paniki and Gulat, very rarely seen apart these two are the backbone of the teams combat power. and are very in sync.</p>
      <p>The airship itself is both home and stage to the members of the circus, with 4 floors and enough space on the top to hold the big top tent and a double row of vendor stalls. Ringmaster Crowe can occasionally be seen talking to the ship and late at night it almost seems to be breathing.</p>
